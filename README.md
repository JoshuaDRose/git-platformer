<i>Yes, that is actually the name of the project. Not a typo...</i>

<h2>What the heck is this?</h2>
<p>
Glatformer (name is still wip) is a feature repository for git version control testing.
Branches, issues and releases will be verbose and at times unneeded. This is intentional, as this repository is to serve as an
example of the git workflow in which development should be done. Similiar projects include the starred repositories I have listed under 'pygame'.
